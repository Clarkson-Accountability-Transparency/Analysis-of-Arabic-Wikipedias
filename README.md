# Learning From Arabic Corpora But Not  Always  From Arabic  Speakers:  A Case Study of the Arabic Wikipedia  Editions

In this repository, we contribute the scripts we wrote to analyze Arabic Wikipedia editions: Modern Standard Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, and Moroccan Arabic, comparing them to the English Wikipedia using Wikimedia Statistics (Wikistats). 

The results of this analysis are used in our accepted paper "*Learning From Arabic Corpora But Not Always From Arabic Speakers: A Case Study of the Arabic Wikipedia Editions*" in the Seventh Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop (WANLP 2022), EMNLP 2022, Abu Dhabi, UAE (Dec 8th, 2022).
