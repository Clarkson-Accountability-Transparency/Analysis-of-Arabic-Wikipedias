# Learning From Arabic Corpora But Not  Always  From Arabic  Speakers

In this repository, we contribute the scripts and data we used to analyze Arabic Wikipedia editions: Modern Standard Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, and Moroccan Arabic, comparing them to the English Wikipedia using Wikimedia Statistics ([Wikistats](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/all-projects)). 

The results of this analysis are used in our **accepted** paper "***Learning From Arabic Corpora But Not Always From Arabic Speakers: A Case Study of the Arabic Wikipedia Editions***" in [the Seventh Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop (WANLP 2022)](https://sites.google.com/view/wanlp2022/), EMNLP 2022, Abu Dhabi, UAE (Dec 8th, 2022).
